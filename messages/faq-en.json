    "question": "How and when can I drive the Nürburgring Nordschleife?",
    "answer": "The Nürburgring Nordschleife opens regularly for public driving sessions. Usually theses are weekday evenings and all day on the weekends and bank holidays.\n\nIn addition to these public sessions for normal traffic, there are also private trackdays. These are private events, open to limited numbers. Typically you will find one or two events per month throughout the season.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n• If you can't see the day you want to drive in the list of public openings, then it's not open to the public on that day.\n• If you're looking for a date in a long time in advance and that whole month shows no opening times, then it hasn't been published yet.\n• Have patience. Rent4Ring does not control Nürburgring opening times and cannot guarantee any published times or take responsibility for short notice cancellations."

    "question": "What is the difference between a Basic and Arrive&Drive rental?",
    "answer": "We offer two rental packages:\n\nThose are the only differences.\n\nOur Arrive&Drive-Packages are the easiest and most convenient way for your Nurburgring self drive experience. All you have to do is to come to our shop, sign the rental agreement and take the keys for your rental car.\n\nWe will take care of that as well as for providing the Nordschleife lap tickets included in the chosen package. The prices for all our packages as well as all other rental tariffs are listed here."

    "question": "How does the insurance work? How much do I have to pay if I crash?",
    "answer": "Our rental prices already include STANDARD insurance with an \"excess,\" or maximum liability. This \"excess\" is your liability, your responsibility.\n\nMaximum liabilities with STANDARD insurance:\n• MINI Cooper S: €12,000\n• Toyota GR Yaris: €20,000\n• Toyota GR Supra: €20,000\n• Porsche 718 Spyder RS: €20,000\n• Porsche 911 GT3RS: €30,000\n• Ferrari F8 Tributo: €30,000\n\nImportant: Nürburgring barriers, charges, and recovery are NOT covered in the STANDARD insurance.\n\nMaximum liabilities with PREMIUM insurance:\n• MINI Cooper S: €6,000\n• Toyota GR Yaris: €10,000\n• Toyota GR Supra: €10,000\n\nThe PREMIUM insurance package covers Nürburgring barriers, charges, and recovery within the excesses listed above.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nWe reserve the right to ask for your excess payment upfront, as a \"deposit\" or \"kaution,\" to be held on a credit card while you're driving.\n\nEven if this seems unfamiliar to you, please consider the following points:\n1. In your own car or a regular airport rental, you probably don't have any insurance when driving on the Nürburgring Nordschleife. For many years, even German insurance companies have excluded Touristenfahrten from coverage.\n2. Our excesses are noticeably lower than our competitors. We invest a lot of time and effort into your safety. Our briefings are thorough and detailed."

    "question": "What time should I arrive?",
    "answer": "The timings should be given to you when you've finished booking your car. But normally it looks like this:\n\n• 60-90 minutes before track/session opens: Arrival at Rent4Ring, completion of paperwork and payment.\n• 30 minutes before track opens: first Briefing begins. If you miss the start, you will have to wait for another briefing at our convenience. You may lose track time.\n• Nürburgring opens: If you've not arrived and not contacted us, we will rent your car to the first person walking through the door.\n\nAlways keep an eye on the opening times as they can often change with no warning. We don't control the opening times."

    "question": "How do I get to Rent4Ring?",
    "answer": "We provide a map on our website.\n\nJust type in this address to your GPS-device:\nBurgstrasse 1, 53520 Nürburg.\n\nWe are located in the heart of the Nurburgring: In Nurburg, a bit less than one kilometer away from the main entrance to the Nordschleife (Doettinger Hoehe).\n\nVERY IMPORTANT:\n\nNürburg or Nürnberg? Every month we deal with one or two customers who have gone to Nürnberg (Nuremberg). This is approximately 400kms and 4-hours of driving away from us. Nürburg is a small village with a massive track around it. Nürnberg is a massive city with a small street-circuit built at the old Nazi parade grounds. Don't be confused.\n\nPublic transportation. The trains will only get you as far as Ahrbruck (from the North) or Mayen (from the East). These stations are still over 20kms away and the bus services are sporadic at best. Ahrbruck is a very small station in a small village and it might be hours before you see a taxi. We always recommend hiring a rental car either from the airport or Köln main station."

    "question": "When should I visit the Nürburgring?",
    "answer": "Let's be really honest; we know that the Eifel weather can be rubbish. We've seen snow falling in June, we've seen it sunny in December. But there's a normally a pattern, with August being the best month for the weather. April, May and June can all be quite wet, but September and October are often very good.\n\nBest times to visit:\n• Spring (April-June): Good weather, fewer crowds\n• Summer (July-August): Best weather, busier sessions\n• Autumn (September-October): Excellent weather, moderate crowds\n\nAlways check the weather forecast and opening times before planning your visit."
